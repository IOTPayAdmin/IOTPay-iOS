## Step 2: Setup View
Declare the view before viewDidLoad. This is not mandatory for display the view, but you will need it for the send request event in step 3.
```
var cardInfoView: IOTCardInfoViewSingleLine!
```

Add following code in ViewController after viewDidLoad

```
cardInfoView = IOTCardInfoViewSingleLine(action: .addUser, style: .roundRect)
view.addSubview(cardInfoView)
```
This will start the interface for user to fillin the card info.




## Step 3: Send the Request
After user filling the card info, sending the request by:
```
IOTNetworkManager.shared.sendRequest(secureId: "your secureId", cardInfoPrivder: cardInfoView)
